# 3DPrintsByMango
3d prints converted to standard format made by me!
do whatever you want with these I really dont care, just dont say
they're yours and blame me for stealing it.
also sorry if you cant use this with your printer, if it doesn't 
then you maybe got the wrong file so check that
and if you didn't, then sorry, i probably just converted it wrong, 
comment to me whatever it was and i might fix 
it. Anyway i use a Anycubic Kobra Max if you were wondering.
